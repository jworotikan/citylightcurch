It is hosted by an THE ROCKS staff member and volunteers, and provides an overview of the mission, strategy, and opportunities for connection at THE ROCKS.  This is the perfect place for us to get to know you better and for you to find out about the right NEXT step for you to get involved more at THE ROCKS.</p>

				<p>LINKs are small groups of approximately six married couples or eight to twelve individuals that meet weekly in someone’s home for sharing, study, discussion, and prayer. They’re for adults of all ages, stages of life, and spiritual maturity.<br/><br/>

				We believe that significant life change best takes place in the context of intentional relationships. LINKs are the places where real life and real issues are discussed. This is the environment to celebrate the successes and good times of life, as well as comfort one another in the tough and disappointing times. It’s a place to be encouraged, equipped, and challenged to grow in our relationship with Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>

				That’s why we encourage everyone to participate in a LINK. Small groups are not a nice addition to our ministry, they are the heart of our ministry. That’s why we place such a high premium on group life.</p>
