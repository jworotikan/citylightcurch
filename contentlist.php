				<h2>OUR FOUR AMAZING ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
			</div><!--/end Headline Center-->

				<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 xs-margin-bottom-30">
					<h4>TODDLER – TINY TOTS</h4>
					<p>In TINY TOTS, children will DISCOVER early who God is.  They learn about God through interactive stories, fun songs, and crafts and activities. Parents could accompany their child when they bring their child in for the first time or until they are comfortable to be on their own. It is important for them to be familiar with the new environment. Your child will join in more as they become comfortable in the group and familiar with the teachers and the environment.</p>

					<h4>PRESCHOOLERS – NOAH’S ARK</h4>
					<p>Noah’s Ark is our environment for preschool-aged kids. It is the place where parents bring their preschoolers and where volunteers introduce these little ones to their Heavenly Father. And that’s the MOST IMPORTANT thing we do for our preschoolers. We introduce them to their Heavenly Father. Our MISSION in Noah’s Ark is: To make a FIRST IMPRESSION of the Heavenly Father in such a way that it makes a LASTING IMPRESSION on the heart of a child. Every week we have this incredible opportunity to make an impression of our Heavenly Father, our Creator, in such a way that our preschoolers will grow up ALWAYS believing that there is a God who made them, who loves them, and who wants to be their friend FOREVER!</p>

					<h4>PRIMARY SCHOOL – LIL’ ROCKERS</h4>
					<p>Lil’ Rockers is an environment for Primary School-aged kids (Year 1- year 5). It includes an engaging large group gathering for worship and teaching from the Bible, followed by a more personal small group time with caring leaders and children their same age. The small group time allows children to build quality friendships. We want Lil’ Rockers to be the best hour of your child’s week.<br>

					We work hard to help each child understand and embrace the following big ideas:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>I need to make the WISE choice.</li>
						<li>I can TRUST GOD no matter what.</li>
						<li>I should treat OTHERS the way I want to be treated.</li>
					</ul>
					If you are new to Lil’ Rockers please browse below for more information.</p>

					<h4>MIDDLE SCHOOL – FLASHPOINT</h4>
					<p>Flashpoint is a link environment for preteens (Year 6 to Year 8) that allows students to ask their tough theological questions, learn how to daily apply truths in the Bible, and have their faith challenged while having fun. Each session has elements of worship, a focussed discussion on a bible related topic, and prayer.<br>

					We work hard to help preteens embrace the following three key ideas:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>My relationship between God and others matter</li>
						<li>My faith is my confidence in what I hope for and assurance about what I do not see</li>
						<li>I need to apply godly wisdom to make the right choices</li>
					</ul>
